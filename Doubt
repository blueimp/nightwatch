Hallo Sebastian,

I have been not capable to find a way to oepn an issue. Sorry if this message, bothers you in any way.

First of all, thanks for your job, I'm using your nightwatch image to do some testing. On mac platform everything is working really well, no problems at all. 

When I deploy to a droplet on digital ocean, and run the same environment I'm finding this problem:

Couldn't save screenshot to  /home/node/spec/Check-existence-of-Kundenservice-contact-form-and-Google-Recaptcha_FAILED_May-26-2016-122917-GMT+0000.png

The volume on the system is doing the reference to the folder on the container, but for some reason has no rights to write on that path.

Any clue or path that could help me to modify the ssytem on a way I can write on the folder?

Best,

nightwatch:

  volumes:
    - ./test:/home/node
